        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
        <ul>
           <li> Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</li>
        <li> Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
    <li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</li>
<li>  Don’t use masks with valves.</li>
            </ul>
