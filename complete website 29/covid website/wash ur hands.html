        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
        <ul>
       <li> Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
       <li> Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
    <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
<li> Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
<li> Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>  Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
      <li>  If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
    </ul>
        Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
       <b> Masks</b>
        Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
